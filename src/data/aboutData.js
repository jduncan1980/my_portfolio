      "After a decade and a half running my own dog walking business (and in spite of my love for furry four-legged friends), I decided it time for a new challenge. Though it seems like a stretch to pivot from dog walking to tech, I’ve gained many valuable insights that I think apply to development. “Computers aren’t really like dogs, though”, you say… or are they? Puppies and the poorly-trained don’t always do what you want them to, but with patience and persistance, they eventually comply. I think the same can be said about HTML elements styled with CSS!",

      "As a self-employed businessperson, the first thing I learned was that clients often have impossible-to-meet demands, but you can keep them happy by figuring out what they need, and what you're able to deliver. And when you don’t have a boss, you quickly learn accountability: there’s no passing the buck if anything goes wrong. As a dog walker, I was extremely motivated to find new business and increase my client base, and did so by offering flexible and reliable service. When you run a tiny business, this is a necessity. When writing code, it’s important to make that code completely reliable, and flexible enough that it can be updated when necessary.",

      "At forty years old, I am not a digital native. I remember the online experience of the early 90s. I got my first computer, a Dell 386 (with AOL!), and gained access to a whole new world of information. Today, it’s a different world-wide-web. My earliest coding attempts involved various low-budget personal sites, often laid out with frames… remember frames?  Back then, you just wrote HTML and inline styles, and it was all you had. Now, with frameworks like React, creating beautiful, interactive web experiences is a breeze.",

      "Fast-forward to the present: Before starting to grow my developer skill, most of my time in front of a laptop was spent producing electronic music. I like to experiment, and I started writing basic scripts to control music software. Being able to build the tools you need instead of having to rely on what’s readily available is a game changer. It was challenging at first, but the more I worked on it, the better I got, and it didn’t take long to realize that I could write code for a living if I was willing to put in the work. I taught myself as much as I could through various online tutorials, and eventually enrolled in the web development program at Lambda School.",

      "My time so far at Lambda has been nothing if not rewarding. I started with seemingly more experience than many of the other students, some of whom come to me for help when their team leads aren’t available. I try to make sure they actually understand what I’m explaining. “Center a persons <div>, and they will have a website. Teach that person Flexbox, and they can be a web developer” is a silly joke you might hear from your dad, but I really enjoy teaching others, and find I often learn myself in the process. I plan to apply for a team lead position at Lambda in the near future, something both my team lead and the section lead of my cohort have encouraged.",

      "Currently, I’m working on refining my React skills, and learning to write better tests. I also like to experiment with CSS-in-JS libraries, including Material UI, Styled Components/System, and Theme-UI. I’ve been developing a web-based drum machine app using the ToneJS library, which is the most challenging thing I’ve worked on to date. I’d ideally like to work at a music technology company. Music is my other big passion, and who doesn’t  want to combine all the things they are passionate about into one grand unified passion? ",
