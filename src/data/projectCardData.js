      "Fully responsive React App built built using Material-UI. Uses hooks for state management. I tried to make it a little more visually appealing than most To-Do apps. Able to add new to-do items, mark them as completed, and delete either completed or all items from list. Uses localStorage to save user data.",

      "Built with a team of students for my first Build Week challenge at Lambda School. I was the junior of 2 React Devs. My roles included styling (with Material-UI), and building most components.

    title: "Weather App",
    about:
      "This was my second weather app, built because the original was slow and unattractive. I used this one as an excuse to learn Typescript. I also set up a redux store using redux toolkit for the first time, which I found to be a delightful experience compared to setting it up the old fashioned way. Also used: Theme-UI for styling, Algolia Places for the form auto-completion, and weather data courtesy of OpenWeather API.",
